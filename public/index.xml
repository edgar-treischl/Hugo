      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.
Pre-requisites Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Introducing Yourself Online workshop! We look forward to meeting you. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.
Set up RStudio Cloud Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember). I want you to be able to work from your own laptop in this workshop, but Cloud is an important back-up plan should you run into troubles.</description>

      <description>Many students learn to analyze data using commercial packages, even though there is an open-source software with cutting-edge possibilities: R, a programming language with countless cool features for applied empirical research. Practice R introduces R to social science students, inspiring them to consider R as an excellent choice. In a non-technical pragmatic way, this book covers all typical steps of applied empirical research. Learn how to prepare, analyze, and visualize data in R. Discover how to collect data, generate reports, or automate error-prone tasks&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Factorial survey experiments (FSEs) are increasingly used in the social sciences. This paper provides a review about the use of FSEs and aims to answer three research questions. (1) How has this specific research field developed over time? (2) Which methodological advances have been made in FSE research and to what degree are they applied in empirical studies? (3) Which questions remain unresolved and should be addressed in future research? &amp;hellip;</description>

I outlined the scope of the blog in the first blog entry where I explained why I set the scope to R users and people with some programming languages. You may not find what you are looking for if you are not familiar with R or if you do not have any other experience to work with data, because I focus on the data management part in this blog.</description>

      <description>Create, scan, and correct exams with R As instructors, we are creating exams each semester and often we use multiple-choice questions to assess the knowledge of our students. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many times I have manually corrected an exam which is why this blog gives a short introduction and shows why you should use the R exams package for single or multiple choice exams, even if you are not a heavy R user.</description>

      <description>I tried to learn Python several times. Once I had a very peculiar class in which we should learn Python for processing natural language. Well, it was more about text mining than applying Python. I tried to learn Python with the help of several books which introduced and ins and out of Python. Before I started to learn Python, I fluently spoke several other statistics software like R, Stata, and please forgive me, my personal journey started with SPSS.</description>

      <description>Given its ability to handle a large amount of data, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve data-driven decisions under various situations. The present research identifies the necessary conditions for the implementation of an AI-based advisory system (AS) in higher education. Using a factorial survey design, we examine experimentally varied features of an AI-based AS to explore students’ willingness to use it and students’ willingness to share their data as a core challenge for successful implementation &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The blog learning SQL the badass way shows you the basic commands to manage tables and data with SQL. I assume that you are familiar with R (or other programming languages) to manipulate data. For this reason, this page only summarizes main idiosyncrasies of SQL, not concepts that you probably know from any other programming experience. I made the experience that learning new things always takes a lot of time and often I have the impression that many courses are designed without taking your personal experience into account.</description>

      <description>Student evaluation of teaching (SET) is an empirically well-established instrument for quality assurance in higher education. Most research shows that SET is a reliable and valid instrument to measure teaching quality from students&amp;rsquo; perception and in accordance with Seldins statement one may come to the conclusion, that: &amp;rsquo;the opinions of those who eat the dinner should be considered if we want to know how it tastes&amp;rsquo; (Seldin 1993: 40). However, in many instances students can select courses they want to attend before the course starts, and even in mandatory courses students can often decide how regularly they attend. &amp;hellip;</description>
