  I work at the ISB (Staatsinstitut für Schulqualität und Bildungsforschung München) as a data scientist.
  
  Until recently I worked as a postdoctoral research assistant at the Chair of Empirical Economic Sociology, at the University Erlangen-Nürnberg. I studied sociology at the University of Munich, where I graduated in 2013 with a degree in Sociology, focusing on quantitative methods and educational research. I attained my PhD at the University of Mannheim as a part of the Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS). 
  
  Between 2013 and 2015 I worked at the University of Munich as a research assistant at Norman Braun’s chair of quantitative social research (now Katrin Auspurg), where I was also responsible for the quality management and teaching evaluation as a member of the dean of studies Josef Brüderl.

  Before I went to Nuremberg, I worked as research assistant at the Chair Statistics and Methodology (Frauke Kreuter and Florian Keusch) and as project team member (Tobias Wolbring) at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES).
