The gist package provides a set of functions to work with GitHub Gist. It allows you to copy, create, and delete gists via the GitHub API. Moreover, it comes with an R Studio addin - a shiny app - to manage your Gists.

Go to the addin menu to open the gist app. The app shows a list with your gist files and a preview of the code. Pick a gist and copy or insert the code. Furthermore, the app has tabs to create and delete gists as well.
