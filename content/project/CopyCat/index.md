CopyCat is a small R package to copy, paste, and manage code snippets. CopyCat comes with code snippets (minimal examples) that run with implemented data. CopyCat was built as a personal package for the lazy cats, but it may help (new) R users to manage code snippets. It has a graphical interface (RStudio addin), so pick a function and press the insert code button. RStudio inserts the code for you.
