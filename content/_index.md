description: Until recently I worked as senior research fellow at the University Erlangen‚ÄêNuremberg. Most of my research was about evaluation, survey research, and causality. I am also an R enthusiast with a broader view on data science topics such as data visualization, NLP, machine learning. In my spare time I go jogging, swimming or do a bike tour.
